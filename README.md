# Customily .NET Challenge
Congratulations for getting to this point! If you complete this task the job will be almost yours ðŸ’ª  

In this callenge we'll be using the Sample ASP.NET Framework Web Application and the follwoing Model:  
A `Page` has a title and can contain several `Images` and `Texts`. Each of these elements has a position (CoordX,CoordY) on the page:

<insert image>

1)Clone this repo and write the code so we can store the data from [this postman request](https://www.postman.com/collections/4bd9550c6d02794d2006) on a database.  

  * All the entities you create should have a `CreatedDate` and a `ModfiedDate` field. 
  * You can use any database that you want.
  * You must use Entity Framework 6.  

  *(If you don't know how to import a collection into postman, you can check [this guide](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/))*


b)Write an endpoint that receives an (X,Y) pair and returns the `Title` of the pages that have every element with positions > (X,Y).

2)Connect your solution to a PG database hosted on [this Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) and [this ADO.NET Data provider](https://www.npgsql.org/ef6/index.html)

3)Migrate your solution to .NET 6 and run it on VS Code

Take into account that apart from the correct funcioning we'll pay special attention to the **proper application of design patterns** and the  **maintainability** of your code.  

  * Make sure to share your screen and have your camara on at all times. 
  * Googling is completley fine.  
  * You must to complete the challenge using only 1 monitor.
  
You have 3 hours now. Good luck!! ðŸ¤ž
