# Customily .NET Challenge
Congratulations for getting to this point! If you complete this task the job will be almost yours ðŸ’ª  

In this callenge we'll be using the model described below:  
A `Page` has a title and can contain several `Images` and `Texts`. Each of these elements has a position (X,Y) on the page. This is an example of 3 different pages:

1)This repo contains the Sample ASP.NET Framework Web Application. Clone it and write an endpoint that receives a page as a json, and stores it on a database. Use [this postman request](https://www.postman.com/collections/4bd9550c6d02794d2006) as a starting point. Once you are done, the postman request should be working (returning a 2XX). 

  * All the entities you create should have a `CreatedDate` and a `ModfiedDate` field. 
  * You can use any database that you want.
  * You must use Entity Framework 6.  

  *(If you don't know how to import a collection into postman, you can check [this guide](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/))*


b)Write an endpoint that receives an (X,Y) pair and returns the `Title` of the pages that have **every element** with positions >= (X,Y).  
For example, if we call the endpoint passing (3,3) with the 3 Pages listed in the image avobe, we should get "3 stacked texts" as the response

2)Connect your solution to a PG database hosted on [this Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) using [this ADO.NET Data provider](https://www.npgsql.org/ef6/index.html)

3)Migrate your solution to .NET 6 and run it on VS Code

Take into account that apart from the correct funcioning we'll pay special attention to the **proper application of design patterns** and the  **maintainability** of your code.  

  * Make sure to share your screen and have your camara on at all times. 
  * Googling is completley fine.  
  * You must complete the challenge using only 1 monitor.
  
You have 3 hours now. Good luck!! ðŸ¤ž
